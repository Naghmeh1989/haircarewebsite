                The MELODY HAIRCARE's scientists evaluate hundreds of hair products each year, from shampoos, conditioners, hair masks, deep and leave-in conditioners to styling products such as anti-frizz serums, volumizing sprays, hair mousses, hairsprays, dry shampoos, and more. That means we know what actually works and what doesn't.

How? We send label-masked products to a panel of thousands of women across the country who use them in their day-to-day life and evaluate them on everything from performance to packaging to scent. Then, in the Beauty Lab, scientists and chemists use tools to scientifically measure the products' efficacy, like an Instron machine, that lets us gauge a product's conditioning capacity and a swatch-wash station to calculate a shampoo's ability to cleanse or protect against color fade. We also have weathering procedures to mimic hair exposure to UV light and heat styling and an environmental chamber to expose hair to high levels of humidity to test frizz-fighting claims.

According to rigorous MELODY HAIRCARE Lab testing, here are the best hair products and brands that are proven to work for healthy hair, including options for all hair types and textures (dry, damaged, straight, curly, long, natural and more), salon professional products, and styling tools.
